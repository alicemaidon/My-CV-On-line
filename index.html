    <h5>My Academic Cursus</h5>
  </div>

  <p>Upon completing my studies at ESTICE International Management, affiliated with the Universit√© Catholique de Lille, where I obtained a degree in Economics and Management, I enrolled in the MSc International Business program at Kedge Business School in September.
My decision to pursue this program stems from my keen interest in the field of international business. The courses are conducted entirely in English, providing me with the chance to explore opportunities abroad. This program offers the prospect of undertaking internships in international companies, allowing me to delve into the business realm and potentially discover my true vocation.</p>
